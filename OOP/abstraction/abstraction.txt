Abstraction 

the process of hidding the internal implementation 

from abc import ABC

Difference between from import abstractclassmethod , abstractmethod

we can create abstract class 

Eg . class BankAcount(ABC)

we can inherit the abstract class

as we are inheriting we should implement all the methods in the child class

How did you implement OO program in python?
why you are inhering visible

__call__()
Speacciality?



what is decorator? eg?
